Welcome to the repository of our open-source project, **Dimm City Portal**. This platform is designed for enthusiasts and players of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs), allowing them to create, manage, and play their TTRPG experiences directly in their web browser without the need for complicated setup, or yet another subscription.

## Features

- **Web-Based:** Play your favorite TTRPGs right in your web browser without the need for additional software or installations.
- **Multiplayer Support:** Invite friends to join your TTRPG session with multiplayer support, allowing multiple users to engage in a collaborative gaming experience.
- **Simple to Use:** A simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to focus on the fun and not the tech.

## Current Status

This project is just starting and is under active development. We have a few major goals we are working towards currently.

- Basic features to run a TTRPG session.
- NPM packages for both the Portal Client and the Portal Server.
- Simple or automated deployment options.

Once these goals are met we will release a stable v1 release. For now, expect a lot of code changes, bugs, and missing features. Check the [TODO](TODO.md) to see a running list of features we are working on.
